# CS-330_3D_Scene
### Designing Software
When approaching software design, I prioritize understanding the requirements and defining a clear plan before starting implementation. I focus on breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and thinking about the user experience. For my project, I applied this approach by visualizing the final 3D scene and deciding which components to prioritize, such as the textures, lighting, and overall structure.
I followed a step-by-step design process, starting with a 2D photo, then onto sketches, and then refining the details during implementation. This approach allowed me to troubleshoot effectively and refine my ideas. In future projects, I will carry forward these tactics by creating prototypes early and iterating based on feedback or new discoveries during development.
### Developing Programs
When developing programs, I approach the task with flexibility and problem solving in mind. I often start with foundational code to ensure the basic functionality works and then build upon it incrementally. For this project however, we were provided with a solid code foundation. For my 3D scene, I adopted new strategies like focusing on lighting and texture mapping to enhance realism. Iteration played an important role, as I repeatedly tested and adjusted various components to achieve the desired look and feel.
Throughout the milestones, my approach to coding evolved. I started with a basic understanding of the project requirements and gradually expanded my knowledge by experimenting with different techniques. By the end, I felt more confident in my ability to design and implement complex visual elements.
### Achieving Goals Through Computer Science
Computer science is essential in helping me achieve my academic and professional goals. Through computational graphics and visualizations, Iâ€™ve gained skills that are directly applicable to my future endeavors. Academically, I now have a deeper understanding of how visual elements are created and rendered, which will support me in future coursework related to computer graphics and programming.
Professionally, these skills open opportunities in fields such as video game development and software engineering. Knowing how to create realistic and visually appealing graphics adds value to my portfolio and demonstrates my ability to combine creativity with technical expertise. This project has shown me how to apply computational concepts in a tangible way, preparing me for more advanced challenges ahead.
